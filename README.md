Typescript utilities for working with Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization (MISMO) files

## Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization (MISMO)
The Mortgage Industry Standards Maintenance Organization (MISMO) is a Standards Development Organization (SDO) for the mortgage industry.

The MISMO Reference Model is the foundation of most MISMO standards and for many MISMO-based proprietary products such as the Government Sponsored Entities' (GSE) Uniform Mortgage Data Program (UMDP®) exchanges.

The MISMO Reference Model consists of several components including:

- The Logical Data Model which makes it easier for organizations to communicate with business partners regardless of the technologies they choose.
- The XML Schema representation of the data and relationships that support industry business processes.
- The Logical Data Dictionary (LDD) which provides a business centric view of the model.
- The Version 3 SMART Doc® standards which provide formats for electronic formatting of documents; and more.
